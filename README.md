# Resume_Mathplotlib_Streamlit
### I tried to create my CV by mathplotlib in python. it's the .ipynb file. after that I thought, It could be on a web app to everyone could create a CV with it.
### It's not complete and it's just a sample. I wrote it just in three hours. in the near future I will try to make it more complete.
### this is the link of streamli: https://share.streamlit.io/omidgh1/resume_streamlit/MYCV-Stream.py
### If it was in sleep mode, please inform me to run it again.

### Programming is unlimited and I'm learning every minutes during programming. please give me your feedback because it could be very useful for me to improve my knowledge.
### thank you so much
